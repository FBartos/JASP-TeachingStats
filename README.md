# Known bugs

- sequential analysis tab does not hide when summary results are used
- testing - sequential analysis - Bayes factor - the dropdown for hypothesis names does not work
- the "<=" does not work for custom CIs 
- the x-axis range for gaussian is not always perfect - find out how to create a pretty axis ticks from a to b that really start at a end at b
- change the SI computation to an optimization one for gaussian and use it for setting the range if the SI is requested
